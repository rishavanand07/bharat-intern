  To Whom It May Concern,

 <p>My name is Pinaki Shashishekhar Mthan, and I'm thrilled to apply for the senior software engineer position at AeroDouble Aerospace. With over five years of experience using MATLAB And AUTOCAD software to develop, design and oversee projects for a small engineering organization, I hope to apply my skills to help reach your goals. I greatly admire your company's mission of innovating in the market, and the development of the new wing technology inspires me to contribute to a new way of creating aerospace equipment. I'm hoping to grow my career as I adopt greater responsibilities in a senior role.</p>

<p>As you can see in my resume, I have the soft skills needed to create new drawings and plans and work with subject matter experts and builders to achieve results. In my previous role, I was responsible for designing all new machines that could build parts and manipulate materials efficiently. Beyond that, I worked on the project planning board where we brainstormed materials and methods we can use to plan for new equipment development. As a project manager for these responsibilities, I established budgets and schedules and ensured timely delivery to meet our business goals.</p>

<p>You can find my resume attached to this email that showcases more of my prior experience, skills and educational qualifications, but please don't hesitate to ask if you need additional information or documents. I look forward to further sharing how I can contribute to the success of AeroDouble. You can contact me using the contact details at the top of this document.</p>
